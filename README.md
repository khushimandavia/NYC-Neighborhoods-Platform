### NYC Neighborhood Insights Platform***  
**(SQL, NoSQL, Python Dash, MongoDB)**  

This project involved developing an interactive dashboard to provide insights into housing prices, crime rates, and demographic statistics across New York City boroughs. Data was collected from multiple sources, including NYC Open Data and U.S. Census Bureau, and stored using PostgreSQL and MongoDB for seamless integration of structured and unstructured data. The dashboard, built using Python Dash, features heatmaps, trend analyses, and comparative visuals, enabling users to explore borough-level differences effectively. Users can filter information by specific neighborhoods or criteria, such as income levels, population density, and more, providing a dynamic tool for real estate investors, policy makers, and residents to make informed decisions. The dashboard also includes predictive analytics components that estimate future housing prices based on historical trends and external economic factors. This integration of interactive visualizations and predictive analytics makes the tool not only informative but also proactive in addressing the needs of various stakeholders in the real estate market.
